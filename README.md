# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

Welcome to the **Solar System Simulation** project!  
This is a Python-based simulation that visually represents the orbits and motions of planets around the sun.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

In this project, the solar system is modeled using basic physics principles and visualized using simple graphics.  
It demonstrates:

- Planetary orbits
- Relative sizes and distances
- Motion dynamics (basic speed, radius, etc.)

Perfect for practicing physics simulations and graphical representations with Python.

---

## 🛠 Built With

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pygame** for 2D visualization
- **Math / Physics logic** for orbital motion

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the simulation locally:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zuherash/solar.git

# Move into the project directory
cd solar

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python main.py



(Make sure to replace main.py with the actual file name if it's different.)

📦 Requirements
Make sure you have these libraries installed:

pygame

(Or simply install everything via the provided requirements.txt.)
